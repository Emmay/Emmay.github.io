    <p>Bootstrap:Reactive is a Computer Science curricular module for 8th-12th grade students which teaches data structures, event-driven programming, animation, and software testing.</p>
    From July 2015 onwards, I re-wrote and translated the Bootstrap:Reactive lessons, activities, and software libraries, and created professional development workshops delivered at <a href="http://www.cspdweek.org/">CSPdWeek</a> in Golden, CO Summer 2016 and 2017.</p>
